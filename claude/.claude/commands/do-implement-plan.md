We have a detailed action plan to implement. I want you to complete it, following these steps:

1. Verify you're not on master branch. If you find yourself on master, STOP AND ASK ME.
2. Pick up the first un-done task.
3. Verify that the task has not been implemented yet. If it's already implemented, mark it as done and go to step 1.
4. Mark the task as in-progress.
5. Verify that you have everything you need to implement the task, if not, ask me.
6. Implement the task.
7. Verify that you wrote the relevant tests (if applicable) and that pre-existent tests still pass. If not, fix / write them and repeat this step.
8. Mark the task as done.
9. Commit your changes. Commit only, DO NOT PUSH. Don't use "generated" nor "co-authored" crap.
10. Go to step 1.
